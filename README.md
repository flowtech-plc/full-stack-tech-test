# Book Library Feature - Code Review Task

## Overview

As part of your interview process, we'd like you to review a pull request for a new Book Library feature. This feature includes both backend and frontend components, implementing a simple system to view, add, and delete books from a library.

Your task is to review the code as if you were doing a code review for a team member. We want you to identify any issues, suggest improvements, and ensure that the implementation meets our acceptance criteria and best practices.

## Feature Description

The Book Library feature should allow users to:

1. View a list of books
2. Add new books to the library
3. Delete books from the library

The feature consists of:

- A backend API built with Node.js
- A frontend interface built with React and Next.js

## Acceptance Criteria

Please ensure the implementation meets the following criteria:

1. Backend API

   - GET endpoint at `/api/books` that returns a list of all books
   - POST endpoint at `/api/books` that allows adding a new book
   - DELETE endpoint at `/api/books/[id]` that allows deleting a specific book
   - Proper error handling for all endpoints
   - Input validation for the POST endpoint

2. Frontend Display

   - A page that displays a list of all books
   - Each book should display its title, author, and publication year
   - Each book item should have a delete button
   - Proper loading states while fetching data
   - Error handling and display for failed data fetching or operations

3. Data Management

   - Fetch book data from the API on page load
   - Proper state management for the book list
   - Efficient rendering of the book list
   - Update the book list in the UI after successful deletion

4. Code Quality

   - Proper use of TypeScript throughout the application
   - Implementation of error boundaries
   - Adherence to accessibility standards (e.g., proper aria labels, semantic HTML)
   - Presence of unit tests for critical functions and components
   - Tests for the delete functionality

5. Performance

   - Consideration for handling large datasets (e.g., pagination or infinite scrolling)
   - Optimized rendering performance for the book list

6. Security
   - Proper input sanitization in the API
   - No exposure of sensitive data through the API
   - Secure implementation of the delete operation

## Your Task

1. Review the code in this pull request thoroughly.
2. Identify any issues, bugs, or areas for improvement.
3. Consider both obvious problems and subtle issues that might impact functionality, performance, or maintainability.
4. Provide constructive feedback as you would in a real code review.
5. Suggest specific improvements or solutions where applicable.

Remember, the goal is not just to find what's wrong, but to provide helpful feedback that would improve the overall quality of the code and the feature.

Good luck, and we look forward to your review!
